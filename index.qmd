As you land here, you'll see my portrait. Hello! I'm **Gerver**, an interdisciplinary individual exploring the intersections of **economics, environment, and political economy**. @cr-portrait

My background blends **retail**, **small-business development and creation**, **environmental economics**, **political economy**, and **creative technology**. I use **R**, **Quarto**, and **GitHub Pages** to make research more transparent and engaging.
:::

Here are quick links to my work. @cr-links

I hope my posts encourage students—regardless of academic background—to explore **data-driven storytelling**. This line will display a guiding quote. @cr-quote

I’m curious about how **economic systems, social networks, policy, and ecological resilience** shape our world—and how clear, accessible design helps us understand them. Below is a compact view of my core interests. @cr-interests

I’m especially interested in **why and how people spend money on environmental causes**, what’s in it for them, and how these decisions relate to the **value of natural resources and money in macrofinance**—often explored through small, reproducible examples.

When this paragraph scrolls into view, it will reveal a histogram. @cr-myplot

I hope you found this introduction engaging. Feel free to connect or explore my work!
