Hello! I'm **Gerver**, an interdisciplinary individual exploring the intersections of **economics, environment, business, and data**.\
As you read, I’ll reveal a few visuals—starting with a photo. @cr-portrait

My background blends experiences in **manual labor**, **small-business development and creation**, **environmental economics**, **political economy**, and **creative technology**. I use **R**, **Quarto**, and **GitHub Pages** to tell stories that make research more transparent and engaging.\
Here are quick links and profiles. @cr-links

It is my hope that my posts encourage students—regardless of academic background—to explore **data-driven storytelling**.\
This line will display a short quote. @cr-quote

I'm endlessly curious about how **economic systems, social networks, policy, and ecological resilience** shape our world, and how **clear, accessible design** can help us understand them.\
Below is a compact view of my core interests. @cr-interests

In particular, I’m interested in **why and how people spend money on environmental causes**, what’s in it for them, and how these decisions relate to the **value of natural resources and money in macrofinance**—topics I often explore through small, reproducible examples like the one shown. @cr-chart
